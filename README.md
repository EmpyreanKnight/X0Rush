# X0Rush
**SPECIAL NOTICE**: Academic honesty is of vital importance. It's **at your own risk** to plagiarize my project since it deliberately contains **multiple errors** before the end of this term. I'll correct these in next term.
## Introduction
This project is for my Compiler Principle Practice course which implemented an interpreted language X0 with PyQt5 based GUI. X0 is a C-like programming language with a great proportion of capability as C language, except float number and pointer functionalities.

## Usage 
This program is built on Flex, Bison, Python 3.7 (with PyQt5) and Make for Windows. If you have all of these components on your X86-64 Windows computer, the following compilation can be executed:
```
> cd <source path>
> make
> python main.py
```
Otherwise, you can choose to use run `X0Rush.exe` for GUI (you can treat it as a mini IDE), with `x0.exe` in the same repository for source code compilation.

## Specifications
Language and usage specifications are available in `./documentation/specification.pdf`, please refer to this file for further details.
